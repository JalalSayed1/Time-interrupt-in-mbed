# Time interrupt using mbed:
## About the project:
- How to time interrupt a ucontroller using Ticker in the mbed.h library.
- Freq is set to 1000Hz; So, interrupt period = 1ms 

## How to use:
- Open a mbed compiler of your choice and select the ucontroller to use. An example of an online compiler: https://os.mbed.com/
- Compuile `main.cpp` and place the compiled file into the ucontroller.

## What did I learn from it:
- The benefits of using Interrupts over Software Polling.
- Making interrupts and setting the interrupt interval.
- Using functions in C++.
